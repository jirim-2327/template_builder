# No Prompt Bootable Images
Here reside altered .iso images based on the Microsoft Windows Server originals.
Generated by `New-NoPromptIso.ps1` script.

The difference from original images is that `efisys.bin` file is replaced with `efisys_noprompt.bin` (file bundled with Microsoft Imaging Tool.).
Normally, installation would ask user to "Press any key to boot…" to boot from CD/DVD (.iso). Of course Packer can send `boot command` with arbitrary delay, so process is fully automated, but "no prompt" .iso will just proceed.

I was able to create "no prompt" images from Server 2025 images, but for some reason the same process don't work for Server 2022 images I've found, so it may seem easier to use `boot command` instead of making new images. 
I wasn't very lucky with quesing the proper timing and sequence for `boot command`, 
```hcl
        boot_wait = "20s"
        boot_command = ["<tab><wait5s><enter><tab><enter><space><wait5s>"]
```
 so I'm using "no promt" method in code for now. Also, the performance of `boot command` may depend on environment / hosts' resources, so the "no promt" is just more reliable. `boot command` also require enhanced session to be disabled.
