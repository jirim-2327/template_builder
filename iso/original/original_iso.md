# Unaltered Microsoft .iso image files

Microsoft .iso file(s), downloaded by script. Descriptive names () are used instead of original ones.

SHA-256 is checked by `Download-WindowsIso.ps1` script unless specified otherwise 

Packer by default expects the "expected" SHA-256 to be provided, and then compare it with the one it calculates, but it is not necessary to do so when it was done before in pipeline/script.
